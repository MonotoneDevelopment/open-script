# open-script
It's a simple, open source, compatible text editor for all your coding needs.

I had this idea after Atom was sunset, and I was also bored. I wanted to make a completely customizable, do whatever the hell you want text editor for coders everywhere. I also wanted this to be completely free and opensource because I'm lazy and people can do stuff for me (Just kidding lol)

Planning on making this possibly able to run code from selected engines and stuff, like selecting Node.js for Javascript.

If you want to split this off into your own, go for it. It's gonna be like Linux. In all different flavors.
